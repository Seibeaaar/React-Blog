# React Blog
React Blog is a simple blog project that gives users the opportunity to read latest posts, comments to those posts and create a new one on their own.

## Getting Started
First, you have to clone the [repository](https://github.com/Seibeaaar/React-Blog.git) of the project by typing such command in your terminal:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Seibeaaar/React-Blog.git
```

Then open the cloned project in your code editor and use your terminal to install all dependencies and packages needed by typing such command:
```bash
npm install
```

When all packages are installed, run internal script:
```bash
npm run dev
```
and in the terminal you will get the link to the localhost on port 3000. Open it and there you go.

## Main Stack
Project is built with Typescript with the usage of Next.js, Redux(redux-saga as middleware), styled-components for UI, axios for handling requests.
API used to fetch posts: [Simple Blog API](https://simple-blog-api.crew.red).
